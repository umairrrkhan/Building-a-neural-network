# Building a Neural Network 

## Overview

Welcome to "Building a Neural Network for Fashion Image Generation," a course project focused on using neural networks to generate images of fashion items. This repository contains the code and resources used in the project.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of images of fashion items, including shoes, slippers, and t-shirts. The data is divided into the following subsets:
- Train set: Used to train the neural network for image generation.
- Train Validation set: Used to fine-tune the model and prevent overfitting during training.
- Test set: Used to evaluate the final image generation performance.

## Requirements

To run the code in this project, you need the following dependencies:
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow 2.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
  pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib
